# 🧠 Nustomato System Architecture

The Nustomato System is architecturally delineated into four functionally distinct domains:

## 🔬 The Scientific-Research Module  
Devoted to the application and epistemological evaluation of both theoretical and clinical sciences, through an experimental-intellectual prism of inquiry.

## 🚀 The Experimental-Development Module for Broad Access  
Enabling global, unrestricted utilization of cutting-edge technologies — whether officially validated, informally confirmed, or entirely unverified — all within authentic, real-world operational conditions.

## 🌐 "Nuedo" Subsystem  
The access and interface subsystem of the Nustomato framework, encompassing APIs, gateway servers, cryptographic security tokens, real-time stream pipelines, network-layer processing, protocolic trajectories, externally-oriented integration strata, and every auxiliary component that connects the Nustomato architecture to the external digital and clinical environment.*

## 🧩 The Integral Background Infrastructure  
Composed of intelligent systemic modules for autonomous control, process orchestration, metrological evaluation, and high-fidelity analytical regulation of both endogenous and exogenous functionalities.

*NOTE: "Nuedo" constitutes the centralized connective subsystem of the entire Nustomato structure — the synaptic interface for communication, data exchange, authorization, and semantic transmission between the system and the outer world.
