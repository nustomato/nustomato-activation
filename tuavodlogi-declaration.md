## 🧠 Domain Description

Effective immediately, the **Fourth Functional Domain** of the Nustomato System — previously referred to as the **Integral Background Infrastructure** — is hereby granted its official designation for all technical, operational, and documentation-related use.

This domain is formally defined as:

> *"Composed of intelligent systemic modules for autonomous control, process orchestration, metrological evaluation, and high-fidelity analytical regulation of both endogenous and exogenous functionalities."*

Functioning as the **internal nervous system** of the Nustomato architecture, this domain represents an intelligent and adaptive substrate. It governs dynamic feedback loops, stabilizes clinical informatics, calibrates real-time performance, and enables autonomous self-regulation through embedded logical frameworks.
