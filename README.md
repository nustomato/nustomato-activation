## 📡 Official System Activation Entry

On January 1st, 2026, during the earliest hours of the new calendar year, the primary cloud servers of the Nustomato system — along with its Nuedo connective access servers — were successfully deployed and activated.

The system was launched with a clear and focused intent: to remain in uninterrupted operational status until December 31st, 2026.

There is reasonable hope that technical, energetic, and organizational conditions will support this continuous cloud-based uptime throughout the year, enabling high-impact research for the benefit of humanity — namely, good people.

We cannot predict the outcome with certainty, but we embark on this process with the intention to enjoy the path as much as the result.
