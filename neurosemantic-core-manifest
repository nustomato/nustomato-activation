# 🧠 Nustomato – An Advanced Scientific Model for Multimodal Transontological Research within Bioinformatic Stomatological Science

The evaluation of a neurosemantic AI meta-architecture embedded within an adaptive, predictive telestomatological infrastructure delineates the experimental axis of a novel epistemological stratum in clinical informatics. The system operates as a distributed, cognitively adaptive platform orchestrated via multimodal flows of structured and unstructured biomedical entities. The clinical-inferential substrate is generated from high-dimensional vectorial representations transposed into semantically interoperable streams aligned with HL7/FHIR paradigms. The embedded ETL protocol integrates ontological translation, graph-topological linkage, and semantic disambiguation, resulting in the construction of inferentially competent data strata. The multimodal neural architecture fuses CNNs, transformer-based models, and GNNs to enable neuroprobabilistic reasoning across temporally stratified diagnostic patterns. Federated training embeds autonomous retraining cycles within decentralized clinical ecosystems, fostering adaptive resilience to input heterogeneity. Personalized prediction of therapeutic trajectories is grounded in the detection of latent etiological sequences within a neurosemantic continuum. Implemented XAI layers deconstruct model opacity through visual attribution, semantic fallback mechanisms, and escalation toward expert cognition. Telestomatological inputs are processed via decision-fusion modules and attention-based algorithms for context-sensitive data weighting. The model transforms asynchronous visual-numerical entities into holistic therapeutic recommendations with ultralow latency. The pharmacosemantic layer redefines bio-pharmaceutical classification through toxico-informational turbulence, bypassing traditional ATC schemas. The hematological-microbiological component functions as a deformable matrix of diachronic causality with semiotic neurogrammatic overlay. The neurotopological layer identifies latent immuno-informational crises and pharmaco-resistant deviations via spectroscopically modulated entity permutations. The system deploys algorithmic eclecticogenesis through a semiotikonic resonator that activates nonlinear epistatic modules independent of explicit annotation. Therapeutic holo-impulses inscribe into the morphogenesis of model behavior via real-time reprogramming of the interpretative stratum. The model incorporates quasi-syntagmatic integration of polymodal vectors into a pharmacodynamic-ontological universe. Each novel clinical interaction redefines the taxonomic matrix of decision-making through semantic re-granularization. Performance evaluation employs a multichannel metrological framework: AUC, F1-score, NPV, PPV, system reactivity, and SUS expert coherence. Clinical output converges toward inter-institutional protocol harmonization, reduction of cognitive burden, and precision-based anticipation of therapeutic responses. The system does not emulate existing diagnostic schemas — it generates its own ontology of healing through the linguistic self-awareness of neurosemantic intelligence.
