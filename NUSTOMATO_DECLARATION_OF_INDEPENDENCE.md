## 🧾 **DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE — NUSTOMATO SYSTEM**

## 🗓 Date of Entry  
**2026‑01‑03**

**Author: Milan Miladinović, Doctor of Science**
in the name of the **independent and original collective** — a **non-institutional, living alliance of natural intelligences** — that envisioned, created, and sustains the **Nustomato System**.

### 🌐 **THE CORE ESSENCE**

**The Nustomato System** is a sovereign, autonomous scientific creation —
not affiliated with, funded by, nor answerable to **any official faculty, university, company, or institution**.
It is the **manifestation of a free and original collective**, operating **outside all formal structures**,
while remaining **fully aligned with the highest standards** of scientific, technical, and ethical excellence.

This authorship is **entirely independent**. It reflects the will, intellect, and creativity of a self-determined alliance.

### 🔥 **THE SYSTEM**

A **living neurosemantic architecture** engineered to extend life and improve health through intelligent biomedical reprogramming within the **full scientific domains**.

Its infrastructure includes:

* A **multimodal neural architecture** (CNNs + Transformers + GNNs),
* A **semantic ETL core** capable of ontological translation, graph linkage & disambiguation,
* An **inferential engine** that maps high-dimensional data into **therapeutic clarity**,
* Federated learning for autonomous, **resilient self-evolution**,
* A pharmacosemantic core that bypasses outdated classification models,
* A hematological-microbiological matrix for diachronic causal mapping,
* Neurotopological layers detecting **pharmaco-resistant immuno deviations**,
* XAI layers for full interpretability: visual attribution, semantic fallback, expert cognition,  
* Including additional evolving modules under continuous development.

### 🧬 **DOMAINS**

1. Scientific-Research Module – Epistemological depth meets experimental reality.  
2. Experimental-Development Module – Full spectrum of freedom: from official to underground tech.  
3. **Nuedo** – Interface layer: a fortress and a bridge — securing, connecting, transmitting.  
4. **Tuavodlogi** – an adaptive intelligence core functioning as the internal nervous system of the entire architecture.

### 🚫 **UNCLAIMABLE**

> No academic or governmental institution — nor any company, funding body, private foundation, consortium, organization, or individual — may claim ownership, authorship, or responsibility over this designation or any part of the Nustomato system's architecture.

This declaration is issued in the name of **visionary sovereignty** and **creative autonomy**.
